## Thoughts

- I sit here, the project only days away
- I have no ideas on what to do, from what I see it's a calculator with the hardest part being the history feature, but I think the most challenging part will most likely be the history feature, and getting used to the racket language

## The Plan Right Now

- Define the main components of this calculator and it's structure
- What parts would this calculator need
- I can define batch and interactive mode later as this seems easy in post as it's just changes to arg param and reading

## What Actions Am I Going To Take

- Well I guess I should start by the most basic part of the calculator, The read eval loop, and taking input

1. How to take input?
2. How to read user input?
